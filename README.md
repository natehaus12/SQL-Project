# Overview

I wrote 2 programs that interact with 2 different SQL databases. I plan to analyze
data from both databases simeoultaneously in the future. 

I wrote this program to learn SQL sytanx and understand how the databases in SQL differ
from cloud databases

# Relational Database

I used the the SQLite extension for my databse tables

Both tables have 2 columns. A name column, and then one with their favorite football team, and the other database
with their locaiton.

# Development Environment

I developed this program using VS code.
I did it just with python with the SQLite3 library. It is awesome and makes it super simple.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Error mitigation (mainly if things alrady exist)
* Integrate the 2 databses together
* Analyze data from each database
